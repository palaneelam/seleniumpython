# __Exercise-5: ****************** LOVE CALCULATORS ****************************************
# __Exercise-5: Write a program that tests the compatiability between two people
# To work out the love score between two people:
#   1. Take both people's name and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs.
#   2. Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs.
#   3. Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number.

# For Love scores less than 10 or greater than 90, the message should be:
# "Your score less than 10 or greater than 90, then message should be:
# "Your score is 'x' you go together like coke and mentos

# For love scores between 40 and 50, the message should be:
# "Your score is 'x' you are alright together.

# otherwise, the message will just be their score. e.g: "Your score is z"
