# Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height
# It should tell them the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value.
#        Under 18.5 they are underweight
#        Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
#        Over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
#        Over 30 but below 35 they are obese
#        Above 35 they are clinically obese
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# user_weight = float(input("Please Enter Weight of user(in KG): "))
# user_Height = float(input("Please Enter Height of user(in meter): "))
# BMI = ((user_weight)/(user_Height*user_Height))
# print("User BMI is: ", BMI)
# # print("User BMI is: ", BMI.__floor__())
#
# if BMI <= 18.5:
#     print("User is Under Weight")
# elif 18.5 < BMI <=25:
#     print("User is Normal Weight")
# elif 25 < BMI <= 30:
#     print("User is Slighly Over Weight")
# elif 30 < BMI <= 35:
